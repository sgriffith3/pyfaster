# PyFASTER

Making Your Python Faster

## Overview

PyFaster is a tool that enables you to test the execution speed of your code easily, and allows iterations.

It also parses your code, looking for patterns that could be improved, and then creates a refactored form of your code, and does a speed comparison for you if desired.
